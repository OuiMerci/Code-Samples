Programming Test 1

This project was made during a weekend for a programming test.
As I remember, the idea was:
- The player can click on the plane to place points and draw polygons
- 2 segments cannot intersect
- When a Polygon is complete, the player can click inside to place a building
- Holding the click will increase the size a building
- The attack input will decrease a building's size over time

This small project was mostly interesting for the geometry challenges it brought:
- Orientation of angles
- Checking intersections of two segments
- Checking if a point is inside a polygon
- ...
